I’d like to invite you to the next Pacific Northwest RHUG on Wednesday, March 2, 2022 from 12:00 - 1:30 PM PT where we’ll cover how to empower your OpenShift developers with a customized developer catalog that fits your unique organizational needs. This event provides a unique platform to hear the benefits of a customized approach vs using the default catalog that comes with OpenShift.
 
Register [here](https://events.redhat.com/profile/514578?sc_cid=7013a000002qCIpAAM) to claim your virtual seat and receive your unique login credentials to join.

Cheers,
